> HttpClient, StringClient, and JsonClient extracted from restify

This module contains HTTP clients extracted from restify.

* JsonClient - sends and expects application/json
* StringClient - sends url-encoded request and expects text/plain
* HttpClient - thin wrapper over node's http/https libraries

The idea being that if you want to support "typical" control-plane REST APIs, you probably want the JsonClient, or if you're using some other serialization (like XML) you'd write your own client that extends the StringClient. If you need streaming support, you'll need to do some work on top of the HttpClient, as StringClient and friends buffer requests/responses.

All clients support retry with exponential backoff for getting a TCP connection; they do not perform retries on 5xx error codes like previous versions of the restify client. You can set retry to false to disable this logic altogether. Also, all clients support a connectTimeout field, which is use on each retry. The default is not to set a connectTimeout, so you end up with the node.js socket defaults.

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install restify-clients`

## Usage

### Client API

There are actually three separate clients shipped in restify:

* **JsonClient:** sends and expects application/json
* **StringClient:** sends url-encoded request and expects text/plain
* **HttpClient:** thin wrapper over node's http/https libraries

The idea being that if you want to support "typical" control-plane
REST APIs, you probably want the `JsonClient`, or if you're using some
other serialization (like XML) you'd write your own client that
extends the `StringClient`. If you need streaming support, you'll need
to do some work on top of the `HttpClient`, as `StringClient` and
friends buffer requests/responses.

All clients support retry with exponential backoff for getting a TCP
connection; they do not perform retries on 5xx error codes like
previous versions of the restify client.  You can set `retry` to `false` to
disable this logic altogether.  Also, all clients support a `connectTimeout`
field, which is use *on each retry*.  The default is not to set a
`connectTimeout`, so you end up with the node.js socket defaults.

Here's an example of hitting the
[Joyent CloudAPI](https://api.us-east-1.joyent.com):

```javascript
var clients = require('restify-clients');

// Creates a JSON client
var client = clients.createJsonClient({
  url: 'https://us-east-1.api.joyent.com'
});


client.basicAuth('$login', '$password');
client.get('/my/machines', function(err, req, res, obj) {
  assert.ifError(err);

  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2));
});
```

As a short-hand, a client can be initialized with a string-URL rather than
an options object:

```javascript
var clients = require('restify-clients');

var client = clients.createJsonClient('https://us-east-1.api.joyent.com');
```

Note that all further documentation refers to the "short-hand" form of
methods like `get/put/del` which take a string path.  You can also
pass in an object to any of those methods with extra params (notably
headers):

```javascript
var options = {
  path: '/foo/bar',
  headers: {
    'x-foo': 'bar'
  },
  retry: {
    'retries': 0
  },
  agent: false
};

client.get(options, function(err, req, res) { .. });
```

If you need to interpose additional headers in the request before it is sent on
to the server, you can provide a synchronous callback function as the
`signRequest` option when creating a client.  This is particularly useful with
[node-http-signature](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature), which
needs to attach a cryptographic signature of selected outgoing headers.  If
provided, this callback will be invoked with a single parameter: the outgoing
`http.ClientRequest` object.

### JsonClient

The JSON Client is the highest-level client bundled with restify; it
exports a set of methods that map directly to HTTP verbs.  All
callbacks look like `function(err, req, res, [obj])`, where `obj` is
optional, depending on if content was returned. HTTP status codes are
not interpreted, so if the server returned 4xx or something with a
JSON payload, `obj` will be the JSON payload.  `err` however will be
set if the server returned a status code >= 400 (it will be one of the
restify HTTP errors).  If `obj` looks like a `RestError`:

    {
      "code": "FooError",
      "message": "some foo happened"
    }

then `err` gets "upconverted" into a `RestError` for you.  Otherwise
it will be an `HttpError`.

#### createJsonClient(options)

```javascript
var client = restify.createJsonClient({
  url: 'https://api.us-east-1.joyent.com',
  version: '*'
});
```

#### get(path, callback)

Performs an HTTP get; if no payload was returned, `obj` defaults to
`{}` for you (so you don't get a bunch of null pointer errors).

```javascript
client.get('/foo/bar', function(err, req, res, obj) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%j', obj);
});
```

#### head(path, callback)

Just like `get`, but without `obj`:

```javascript
client.head('/foo/bar', function(err, req, res) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
});
```

#### post(path, object, callback)

Takes a complete object to serialize and send to the server.

```javascript
client.post('/foo', { hello: 'world' }, function(err, req, res, obj) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
  console.log('%j', obj);
});
```

#### put(path, object, callback)

Just like `post`:

```javascript
client.put('/foo', { hello: 'world' }, function(err, req, res, obj) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
  console.log('%j', obj);
});
```

#### del(path, callback)

`del` doesn't take content, since you know, it should't:

```javascript
client.del('/foo/bar', function(err, req, res) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
});
```


### StringClient

`StringClient` is what `JsonClient` is built on, and provides a base
for you to write other buffering/parsing clients (like say an XML
client). If you need to talk to some "raw" HTTP server, then
`StringClient` is what you want, as it by default will provide you
with content uploads in `application/x-www-form-url-encoded` and
downloads as `text/plain`.  To extend a `StringClient`, take a look at
the source for `JsonClient`. Effectively, you extend it, and set the
appropriate options in the constructor and implement a `write` (for
put/post) and `parse` method (for all HTTP bodies), and that's it.

#### contentMd5

The `contentMd5` option to `StringClient` specifies how content-md5 response
headers are handled:

```javascript
var contentMd5 = {
  ignore: false,
  encodings: undefined
};
```

By default if a server responds with a `content-md5` header, `StringClient` will
automatically verify the response body md5 hash, and return a `BadDigest` error
when it does not match. You can disable this behaviour by setting the
`contentMd5.ignore` option to true when creating the StringClient instance. You
can also set the `contentMd5.encodings` property to be an array of encoding
names that StringClient will use to verify the md5. The default encoding is
"utf8" for node 6 and above, and "binary" (a latin1 encoding) for node 4 and
older (as node changed the default crypto hash encoding between versions 4 and
6). To support content-md5 hashes generated by both node 4 and 6 servers, you
can specify `contentMd5.encodings = ["utf8", "binary"]` when creating the
StringClient instance.

#### createStringClient(options)

```javascript
var client = restify.createStringClient({
  url: 'https://example.com'
});
```

#### get(path, callback)

Performs an HTTP get; if no payload was returned, `data` defaults to
`''` for you (so you don't get a bunch of null pointer errors).

```javascript
client.get('/foo/bar', function(err, req, res, data) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%s', data);
});
```

#### head(path, callback)

Just like `get`, but without `data`:

```javascript
client.head('/foo/bar', function(err, req, res) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
});
```

#### post(path, object, callback)

Takes a complete object to serialize and send to the server.

```javascript
client.post('/foo', { hello: 'world' }, function(err, req, res, data) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
  console.log('%s', data);
});
```

#### put(path, object, callback)

Just like `post`:

```javascript
client.put('/foo', { hello: 'world' }, function(err, req, res, data) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
  console.log('%s', data);
});
```

#### del(path, callback)

`del` doesn't take content, since you know, it should't:

```javascript
client.del('/foo/bar', function(err, req, res) {
  assert.ifError(err);
  console.log('%d -> %j', res.statusCode, res.headers);
});
```

### HttpClient

`HttpClient` is the lowest-level client shipped in restify, and is
basically just some sugar over the top of node's http/https modules
(with HTTP methods like the other clients).  It is useful if you want
to stream with restify.  Note that the event below is unfortunately
named `result` and not `response` (because
[Event 'response'](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html#event_response_)
is already used).

```javascript
client = restify.createClient({
  url: 'http://127.0.0.1'
});

client.get('/str/mcavage', function(err, req) {
  assert.ifError(err); // connection error

  req.on('result', function(err, res) {
    assert.ifError(err); // HTTP status code >= 400

    res.body = '';
    res.setEncoding('utf8');
    res.on('data', function(chunk) {
      res.body += chunk;
    });

    res.on('end', function() {
      console.log(res.body);
    });
  });
});
```

Or a write:

```javascript
client.post(opts, function(err, req) {
  assert.ifError(connectErr);

  req.on('result', function(err, res) {
    assert.ifError(err);
    res.body = '';
    res.setEncoding('utf8');
    res.on('data', function(chunk) {
      res.body += chunk;
    });

    res.on('end', function() {
      console.log(res.body);
    });
  });

  req.write('hello world');
  req.end();
});
```

Note that get/head/del all call `req.end()` for you, so you can't
write data over those. Otherwise, all the same methods exist as
`JsonClient/StringClient`.

One wishing to extend the `HttpClient` should look at the internals
and note that `read` and `write` probably need to be overridden.

#### Proxy

A restify client can use an HTTP proxy, either via options to `createClient`
or via the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables
common in many tools (e.g., `curl`).

```javascript
restify.createClient({
  proxy: <proxy url string or object>,
  noProxy: <boolean>
});
```

The `proxy` option to `createClient` specifies the proxy URL, for example:

```javascript
proxy: 'http://user:password@example.com:4321'
```

Or a proxy object can be given. (Warning: the `proxyAuth` field is not what
a simple `require('url').parse()` will produce if your proxy URL has auth
info.)

```javascript
proxy: {
  protocol: 'http:',
  host: 'example.com',
  port: 4321,
  proxyAuth: 'user:password'
}
```

Or `proxy: false` can be given to explicitly disable using a proxy -- i.e. to
ensure a proxy URL is not picked up from environment variables.

If not specified, then the following environment variables (in the given order)
are used to pick up a proxy URL:

    HTTPS_PROXY
    https_proxy
    HTTP_PROXY
    http_proxy

Note: A future major version of restify(-clients) might change this environment
variable behaviour. See the discussion on [this issue](https://github.com/restify/node-restify/issues/878#issuecomment-249673285).


The `noProxy` option can be used to exclude some hosts from using a given
proxy. If it is not specified, then the `NO_PROXY` or `no_proxy` environment
variable is used. Use `noProxy: ''` to override a possible environment variable,
but not match any hosts.

The value is a string giving a comma-separated set of host, host-part suffix, or
the special '*' to indicate all hosts. (Its definition is intended to match
curl's `NO_PROXY` environment variable.) Some examples:


    $ export NO_PROXY='*'               # don't proxy requests to any urls
    $ export NO_PROXY='127.0.0.1'       # don't proxy requests the localhost IP
    $ export NO_PROXY='localhost:8000'  # ... 'localhost' hostname and port 8000
    $ export NO_PROXY='google.com'      # ... "google.com" and "*.google.com"
    $ export NO_PROXY='www.google.com'  # ... "www.google.com"
    $ export NO_PROXY='127.0.0.1, google.com'   # multiple hosts

**Note**: The url being requested must match the full hostname or hostname
part to a '.': `NO_PROXY=oogle.com` does not match "google.com". DNS lookups are
not performed to determine the IP address of a hostname.


#### basicAuth(username, password)

Since it hasn't been mentioned yet, this convenience method (available
on all clients), just sets the `Authorization` header for all HTTP requests:

```javascript
client.basicAuth('mark', 'mysupersecretpassword');
```

#### Upgrades

If you successfully negotiate an Upgrade with the HTTP server, an
`upgradeResult` event will be emitted with the arguments `err`, `res`, `socket`
and `head`.  You can use this functionality to establish a WebSockets
connection with a server.  For example, using the
[watershed](https://github.com/jclulow/node-watershed) library:

```javascript
var ws = new Watershed();
var wskey = ws.generateKey();
var options = {
  path: '/websockets/attach',
  headers: {
    connection: 'upgrade',
    upgrade: 'websocket',
    'sec-websocket-key': wskey,
  }
};
client.get(options, function(err, res, socket, head) {
  res.once('upgradeResult', function(err2, res2, socket2, head2) {
    var shed = ws.connect(res2, socket2, head2, wskey);
    shed.on('text', function(msg) {
      console.log('message from server: ' + msg);
      shed.end();
    });
    shed.send('greetings program');
  });
});
```

### Common APIs

The following methods are shared by all versions of the client:

#### inflightRequests()

Returns the number of inflight requests the client is currently handling. The
request count is incremented as soon as a verb method is called, which means
that an inflight request is defined as a request that is in any of the
following states:

* after the verb function is called but before any I/O
* waiting on I/O (dns resolution, socket connection, server response, etc.)
* request serialization (uploading of req bodies, etc.)
* response marshalling/consumption

The counter is decremented when the response's `end` event is emitted, or when
the request's `error` event is emitted.


### Events

The client emits the following events:

#### client.on('timings', function(timings) {... });
Per request timings are available under the `req.getTimings()` or emitted from
the client via a `timings` event in milliseconds:

```javascript
{
  dnsLookup: 34,
  tcpConnection: 52,
  tlsHandshake: 112,
  firstByte: 66,
  contentTransfer: 2,
  total: 266
}
```

All timings except `total` can be `null` under various circumstances like
keep-alive connection, missing https etc.

#### client.on('metrics', function(metrics) {... });
Per request metrics are available under the `req.getMetrics()` method, and are
also emitted from the client via a `metrics` event:

```javascript
{
  statusCode: 200,
  method: 'POST',
  success: true,
  path: '/foo/bar',
  url: 'http://netflix.com',
  timings: {
    dnsLookup: 34,
    tcpConnection: 52,
    tlsHandshake: 112,
    firstByte: 66,
    contentTransfer: 2,
    total: 266
  }
}
```

#### client.on('after', function(req, res, err) {... });
The client will emit an `after` event after each completed request
(successful or not). This can be useful for attaching after handlers to report
metrics or other useful information about the client. When using this event,
the timings and metrics information is available via the request getters,
`req.getTimings()` and `req.getMetrics()`.

For the StringClient and JSONClient, the `after` event is fired after the
response has been received and parsed. For the HttpClient, usage is a bit more
nuanced, which will be covered below.

##### Using the `after` event with the HttpClient

As the low level HttpClient's callback interface exposes the associated request
and response streams directly to the consumer, there are a few caveats around
using `after` with the HttpClient. Consumers must consume the response stream
(by consuming the `data` event on the response) in order for the `after` event
to be fired. For example, here's how an HttpClient instance consumes the
response's data to trigger the `after` event:

```javascript
httpClient.get('/200', function (err, req) {
  req.on('result', function (err, res) {
    let body = '';
    // must consume the stream first
    res.on('data', function (chunk) {
      body += chunk;
    });
  });
});

httpClient.once('after', function (req, res, err) {
  // this is fired after response's `end` event.
});
```

Another effect due to the low level nature of HttpClient means that any errors
created in the consuming callback will not be available automatically in
the `after` event. For example, if you get a 500, but then determine that your
payload has some bad or malformed data, or you encounter an error while
consuming your stream, it's your responsibility to propagate that back to
`after` if you want to consume it later:

```javascript
httpClient.get('/500', function (err, req) {
  req.on('result', function (err, res) {
    // err is an InternalServerError here. but a 500 could still return
    // some data like an error message, so let's parse the response now.
    res.on('data', function (chunk) {
      // parse the chunks here...
      // oh no, bad data! but how do I get this error to the after event?
      var invalidDataError = new Error('invalid data format!');
      // attach it to the req or res object
      req.httpClientError = invalidDataError;
    });
  });
});

httpClient.once('after', function (req, res, err) {
  // err will be an InternalServerError, and req.httpClientError will be your
  // custom error.
});
```

In timeout scenarios (connection timeout or request timeout), there is no
response to consume, in which case the client's `after` event is fired at the
same time as the req's `result` event.
